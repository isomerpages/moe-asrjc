In 2016, Madam Saadiah was nominated by colleagues and students for the inaugural Outstanding Economics Teacher Award organised by the Economic Society of Singapore (ESS). Some 130 nominations were received for 33 economics teachers and Madam Saadiah is one of the five finalists who were recognised for their contributions to the teaching and learning of Economics.
