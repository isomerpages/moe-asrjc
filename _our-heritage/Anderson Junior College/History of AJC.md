#### History of AJC

**AJC Vision**  
Anderson Junior College’s vision is to nurture passionate learners, adventurous thinkers and caring leaders.

**AJC Motto**  
AJC’s motto Non Mihi Solum (Not for Myself Alone) galvanises students to champion positive change, inspire others, and build community. The college believes that Singapore would develop into a nation of excellence if each person regards it as his duty to reach his full potential not only for himself, but for others as well.

**The Campus**  
Receiving its first batch of students in 1984, Anderson Junior College was the 11th junior college to be established in Singapore. Mr Heng Chiang Meng, then Member of Parliament for Jalan Kayu SMC, officiated the opening ceremony of the college.

Led by Mr Lee Fong Seng with 79 academic staff in its first year, the college grew in strength and stature, with almost 150 academic staff and 15 Heads of Departments in 2018.

The Anderson Junior College Hostel commenced construction in 2009 and was completed in 2012 to better serve the needs of international students in the college.
