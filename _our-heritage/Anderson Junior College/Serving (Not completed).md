**AJCares**  
In keeping with the college motto Non Mihi Solum, AJC always regarded service as integral for a holistic education. Service-Learning was implemented in 2001 to build a strong sense of service among students and provide opportunities for student ownership as they engaged in meaningful projects to serve the community. Through this programme, students also built social, civic, and academic skills. In 2015, the college initiated AJCares, a college clean-up effort, which saw students rolling up their sleeves to clean the college while appreciating the non-teaching staff. In 2017, the college repackaged it to encompass AJCares for AJ and AJCares for Community, the first focusing on the college and the latter on the Ang Mo Kio community. This was to engage students’ hearts and minds to care for their environment, to better serve the needs of the immediate community, and to reflect on their role in moving Singapore forward. Through AJCares for Community, students better understood their community and themselves.

**Serving the Community**  
Serving the community always underpinned the philosophy of education in AJC. Over the years, AJCians had a multitude of opportunities for serving the college, the country and the international community. The first Overseas Community Involvement Programme (OCIP) project to Inner Mongolia in 1997 marked a significant milestone in AJC’s participation in community service. Since then, OCIP trips to various countries and regions, including Chiangmai, Vietnam, Laos, Indonesia and Hainan became a regular affair. AJCians taught English, interacted with the locals, and constructed facilities for the betterment of people’s lives in their various projects. Through these meaningful ventures, AJCians learnt invaluable lessons in love, humility, and service.
