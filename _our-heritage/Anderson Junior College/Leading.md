#### Leading

**Nurturing Leaders**

In 1988, 60 student leaders underwent the collegeâ€™s first Alpha-Bravo (AB) Camp to prepare them for effective leadership. Participants of the camp were put through physically and mentally gruelling activities to learn about team spirit and leadership skills. Since then, the AB camp grew in stature over the years, and this signature annual event took in over 200 JC1 student leaders comprising Student Councillors, CCA Heads and Class Leaders by 2017. Being a student-led camp that aimed to impart effective leadership lessons through experiential learning activities, JC2 student leaders stepped up to take on leading roles as AB Camp Student Instructors to conceptualize and execute the event. Over the years, innovative ways of teaching leadership skills were also infused into the camp: dragon-boating teambuilding races, overnight night trekking, high elements obstacle courses and even escape rooms!
