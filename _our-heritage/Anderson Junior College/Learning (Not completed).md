**North Zone Centre of Excellence for Science (Elementz)**  
As the North Zone Centre of Excellence (CoE) for Science, AJC promoted critical and inventive thinking through building a science research culture among students and teachers. Equipped with high-end science laboratories, the Elementz Lab and the Nanoscience Lab, AJC students had ample opportunities to develop their passion for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The CoE also aimed to level up the content knowledge and curriculum, pedagogical and assessment practices of science teachers in North Zone schools by providing workshops and training for them. AJC also hosted the annual Elementz Science Research Conference and Exhibition since 2001. Co-organised by students, the event attracted the participation of student projects from both local and overseas schools, including those from Australia, China, Thailand, and Vietnam.
