#### Learning

**North Zone Centre of Excellence for Science (Elementz)**  
As the North Zone Centre of Excellence (CoE) for Science, AJC promoted critical and inventive thinking through building a science research culture among students and teachers. Equipped with high-end science laboratories, the Elementz Lab and the Nanoscience Lab, AJC students had ample opportunities to develop their passion for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The CoE also aimed to level up the content knowledge and curriculum, pedagogical and assessment practices of science teachers in North Zone schools by providing workshops and training for them. AJC also hosted the annual Elementz Science Research Conference and Exhibition since 2001. Co-organised by students, the event attracted the participation of student projects from both local and overseas schools, including those from Australia, China, Thailand, and Vietnam.

**Anderson Science Programme in Research and Enrichment (ASPiRE)**  
ASPiRE was AJC’s signature science research programme. Comprising a two-tier _Science Adventurers_ and _Science Pioneers_ structure, ASPiRE aligned its objectives to the CoE’s goals to develop scientific skills and cultivate students with the heart to advance science for the betterment of society. All AJC Science students experienced ASPiRE as _Science Adventurers_, and those who were talented and passionate in science research could stretch themselves further as _Science Pioneers_. Due to the college’s partnership with Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR), Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory (TLL), Singapore Technologies (ST) Engineering, Defence Science Organisation (DSO) National Laboratories, and tertiary institutions like NUS, NTU, and SUTD, _Science Pioneers_ could enjoy research mentorship opportunities, immerse themselves in authentic research environments and learn from practising scientists.
