**Our Tradition**  
In line with the college’s Motto, To Learn To Serve, Serangoon Junior College had a long tradition of serving the community. The culture of care was integral to the identity of the college. In exemplifying it, SRJCians and staff alike have passionately served the community in many ways. As a way to give back to the college, students and staff participated in the annual Use Our Hands Day (started in 2015) by cleaning various areas of the college campus and serving the custodians, an objective that has remained true even though the programme has evolved since the 1990s. In 1999, SRJC organised its inaugural blood donation drive, and in 2017 SR Red Cross Youth Chapter organised it again to an overwhelming response from the student body. The 2000s saw the students actively involved in a myriad of fundraising programmes: the Sands of Mission (2006) project, in which SRJCians built Singapore’s longest sandcastle and raised $50,000 for Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and The Butterflies of Hope, Legacies of Love (2007) project, in which a total of $100,000 was raised for the HCA Hospice Care and SRJC School Improvement Fund.
