**Pioneer Teachers**

Back in 1988, SRJC only had a pioneering staff strength of 45 teachers and yet, there was quite a number who continued to teach. Some of whom include Mrs Katherine Pah, Mdm Saadiah, and Mr Foo Toon Lock who taught in the institution when it first opened its doors to the first batch of JC1 students. One of the prominent pioneer teachers was the late Ms Rosalind Gurupatham Jeyamoney, who taught Literature, and was the inspiration behind Literature Week. Despite battling cancer, she still showed up in class to conduct lessons in a wheelchair. She was truly an inspiration to her students, many of whom credited the Shakespeare-loving teacher with nurturing their passion for the subject.
