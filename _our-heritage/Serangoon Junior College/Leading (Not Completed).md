**Student Leadership Training**  
The development of student leaders was a key part of SR's history. Up till the 2000s, the philosophy of servant leadership was the reference for student leaders in driving their growth. Camp ASPIRE was a student leadership camp born in 2009, with the aim to provide a common training experience for all leaders - Student Councillors, and leaders of classes and CCAs alike. In this camp, outdoor elements, the legendary overnight Leadership Challenge and service-learning components allowed student leaders to learn leadership skills and dispositions in an organic and inductive manner.

**ACE@SRJC**  
The ACE@SRJC Programme was first conceptualised in 2011 with the aim of offering the Collegeâ€™s higher-ability students a leg-up in terms of fulfilling their potential and contributing to the overall good of the community and Singapore. This was done through providing them with opportunities to experientially acquire communication skills, such as the Small Talk and Networking Workshop, and Social Etiquette Course, as well as to interact with significant others to acquire confidence, critical thinking and leadership skills through mentorship programmes and learning journeys. In 2016, the College rebranded ACE@SRJC with a stronger emphasis on holistic development and included the service-to-others component, and hence the programme undertook the iSERVE project, where they provided ad-hoc consultations and mentored struggling students. Through these opportunities to learn, serve and lead, they emerge as students who Appreciate in Values, Contribute in Service and are Empowered for Significance.
