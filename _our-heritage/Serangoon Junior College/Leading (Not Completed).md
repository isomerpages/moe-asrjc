**Student Leadership Training**  
The development of student leaders was a key part of SR's history. Up till the 2000s, the philosophy of servant leadership was the reference for student leaders in driving their growth. Camp ASPIRE was a student leadership camp born in 2009, with the aim to provide a common training experience for all leaders - Student Councillors, and leaders of classes and CCAs alike. In this camp, outdoor elements, the legendary overnight Leadership Challenge and service-learning components allowed student leaders to learn leadership skills and dispositions in an organic and inductive manner.
