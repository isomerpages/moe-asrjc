**Student Leadership Training**  
The development of student leaders was a key part of SR's history. Up till the 2000s, the philosophy of servant leadership was the reference for student leaders in driving their growth. Camp ASPIRE was a student leadership camp born in 2009, with the aim to provide a common training experience for all leaders - Student Councillors, and leaders of classes and CCAs alike. In this camp, outdoor elements, the legendary overnight Leadership Challenge and service-learning components allowed student leaders to learn leadership skills and dispositions in an organic and inductive manner.

**ACE@SRJC**  
The ACE@SRJC Programme was first conceptualised in 2011 with the aim of offering the College’s higher-ability students a leg-up in terms of fulfilling their potential and contributing to the overall good of the community and Singapore. This was done through providing them with opportunities to experientially acquire communication skills, such as the Small Talk and Networking Workshop, and Social Etiquette Course, as well as to interact with significant others to acquire confidence, critical thinking and leadership skills through mentorship programmes and learning journeys. In 2016, the College rebranded ACE@SRJC with a stronger emphasis on holistic development and included the service-to-others component, and hence the programme undertook the iSERVE project, where they provided ad-hoc consultations and mentored struggling students. Through these opportunities to learn, serve and lead, they emerge as students who Appreciate in Values, Contribute in Service and are Empowered for Significance.

**Leadership Opportunities**  
The development of student leaders had evolved over the history of SR. Up until 2007, House Captains were directly elected by the student population, with the five Houses named after constellations from 2002. From 2008, the College began to organise student leaders together as a community and a white polo T-shirt was introduced to offer student leaders a visible identity marker. By 2010, the then-Student Council Investiture became the Student Leaders’ Investiture, thus allowing the students to witness the investiture of every single student leader. The next year, the House leadership was merged with the Student Council. From 2014, with the renewed focus on student centricity, student leaders gained greater autonomy, voice, and initiative. The Student Council evolved from an apex to a nexus – a glue connecting different groups of student leaders, and Councillors collaborated with Class Leaders to drive student-run efforts such as SR Fiesta, Open House, and Orientation.
