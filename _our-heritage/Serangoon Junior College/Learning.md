**Pioneer Teachers**   
Back in 1988, SRJC only had a pioneering staff strength of 45 teachers and yet, there was quite a number who continued to teach. Some of whom include Mrs Katherine Pah, Mdm Saadiah, and Mr Foo Toon Lock who taught in the institution when it first opened its doors to the first batch of JC1 students. One of the prominent pioneer teachers was the late Ms Rosalind Gurupatham Jeyamoney, who taught Literature, and was the inspiration behind Literature Week. Despite battling cancer, she still showed up in class to conduct lessons in a wheelchair. She was truly an inspiration to her students, many of whom credited the Shakespeare-loving teacher with nurturing their passion for the subject.

**Arts@SR**  
	
In the realm of the arts, students were offered a myriad of opportunities to express themselves creatively. Those from Performing Arts CCAs would hold concerts such as the Performing Arts Special and Shiokissimo, where they would present solo performances and collaborative highlights between the different CCAs. Those who were musically inclined would participate in RockFest where they would take the stage in front of a live audience. There were also literary performances such as Not So Macbeth (1990), King Lear (1991), Pai An (1996), and King Hamlet (1998). Finally what started out as a small affair in the early 2000s soon evolved to a week long affair celebrating English Literature, which would then culminate in the much anticipated Literature Night.

In Serangoon Junior College, learning experiences took place both within and outside the classroom. A number of trips to Nepal, Indonesia and Malaysia were made in the early 1990s as part of Outdoor Activities Club’s (ODAC) overseas trips.

The first subject-based overseas trip took place in 2001 when 50 students travelled to England to study the roots of English Literature and observe its current developments. The College also organised a trip to France and China to immerse the History students in authentic environments where their lessons can come alive. Seizing on its potential for meaningful and experiential learning, the College continued to organise overseas trips for the students. This evolved into one of SRJC’s proudest signature programmes, the Serangoon Junior College Global Classroom Experience (SRGCE), which commenced in 2008. Besides outdoor learning and adventure elements, the Service-Learning component was also strongly emphasised in several of the trips to Cambodia, Vietnam and China.

**Learning Beyond the Classroom**  
Across the years, different departments put on learning festivals and workshops that offered supplementary information from human geography to global trends. Since the early 1990s, the Humanities and Commerce Department organised its first Humanities and Commerce Week. It was aimed at promoting awareness and interest in the subjects in a variety of ways. The first GP week was organised to stimulate further interest in the subject by complementing and reinforcing the enrichment activities with publications, public cultural performances, projects and overseas field trips. Other subjects also held similar platforms, with the Mathematics, Science and Humanities departments holding Symposiums for fellow SRJCians and even students from neighbouring secondary schools. The Mother Tongue department also regularly conducted a fortnight of events to celebrate and appreciate the languages and unique customary practices.

**Dedicated Teachers**&nbsp;  
SRJCians have achieved outstanding ‘A’ Level results as evidenced by the consecutive Value-Added Awards for commendable performance from 2010-2013. While these accomplishments are a reflection of the students’ relentless effort and drive to persevere in their pursuit of excellence, such successes would not have been possible had it not been for the teachers’ care and guidance. Among many of these dedicated teachers are:

**Distinguished Speaker Series (DSS)**  
Since 2007, under the purview of the Education and Career Guidance (ECG) committee, SRJC established ‘The Distinguished Speaker Series’, which offered opportunities to learn from the experiences and insights of some of Singapore’s most influential individuals from different fields. Some of the individuals who shared their stories include Dr Tan Lai Yong, the ‘Barefoot Doctor’ who used his talents to help the less fortunate in China, Ms Cassandra Chiu, whose visual impairment did not impede her path to success, the late Mr Subhas Anandan, the eminent criminal lawyer whose conduct of several landmark cases have shaped the face of criminal law in Singapore, Ms Indranee Rajah, the Senior Minister of State for Law and Education and Minister Khaw Boon Wan, the Minister for Transport.

**Outstanding Achievements**   
Despite their humble beginnings, SRJCians have achieved admirable academic and non-academic outcomes. These students truly embodied the recurring message in SRJC’s school song “We lead her to glory / Our best in all we do”.

**CCA Achievements**   
In any endeavour, it was emphasised to SRJCians that the focus should be on the process rather than the outcome. Motivated to put in their best, SRJCians from Performing Arts to Sports to Clubs and Societies made a mark in national competitions and the like. Some prominent accomplishments include:
