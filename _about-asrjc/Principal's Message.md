**_Welcome to Anderson Serangoon Junior College_**

Our vision, “Imaginative Thinkers, Caring Leaders”, encapsulates the overall direction and purpose of ASRJC. By embracing students from more than 120 secondary schools, ASRJC is not only diverse and inclusive, we are also dynamic and enterprising. We will be one of the first colleges to offer a unique blend of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics) education to help prepare our students for a fast changing world.  

If you are looking for a college that will help you grow into a better and stronger person, then ASRJC may be the place for you. ASRJC’s strengths include helping thousands of students to graduate successfully and pursue their preferred courses of choice both locally and overseas. In addition, the caring environment in the college enables all students to grow holistically, pursue their interests in CCAs, attend a range of enrichment programmes and be given opportunities to grow in their leadership and communication skills.            

Get to know ASRJC and let us be part of your growth.
