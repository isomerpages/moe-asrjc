**2022 STEAM Conference**

Science, Arts, or best of both worlds? Our annual STEAM Conference in ASR wants to have it all. To kickstart the conference, the 23rd International Elementz Fair provided the platform for students from 58 schools, including 11 international schools from Vietnam and Thailand, to showcase their scientific research and prototypes that could contribute to the betterment of society.

We then celebrated interdisciplinary learning and the fusion of Arts and Sciences with our 20 unique STEAMinars, or online workshops that provided an immersive experience to learn concepts or real-world issues through the Arts Science synergy. These are specially curated STEAMinars by ASR teachers and students, and professionals from NUS, NTU, SUTD, GUILD and Foreword Coffee.

We concluded with the Arts Symposium that explores and deepens understanding towards local and global issues through the Arts. This year we curated exhibitions and designed activities under the theme - Sustainability - An Exploration through the Arts. What a fun-filled and action-packed April for ASR, all for the purpose of offering an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to learning!
