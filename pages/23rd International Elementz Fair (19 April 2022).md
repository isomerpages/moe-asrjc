**23rd International Elementz Fair (19 April 2022)**

The annual International Elementz Fair (formerly known as Elementz Science Research Conference and Exhibition) aims to provide a platform for Upper Secondary and Junior College students to showcase their primary and secondary scientific research, and prototypes which can contribute to the betterment of society.

The 23rd International Elementz Fair will be featured as a key event in our inaugural 3-day S.T.E.A.M. Conference held from 19th to 21st April 2022. The S.T.E.A.M. Conference aims to allow students to appreciate the integration of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics through talks, workshops and learning journeys.

The 23rd International Elementz Fair will be held entirely online. Students can submit their projects under the following categories:

**Category A: Science Research**

Examine a Science and/or Mathematics problem using **primary research** (i.e. data collected from experiments) ***and/or* secondary research** (i.e. data collected from other official sources).

**Category B: Innovation**

Propose an idea or solution that can address a societal issue that your country faces today or will face in the near future.

The idea or solution should be in accordance with the theme: **Sustainability**.

The invitation letter for the 23rd International Elementz Fair is attached here.

All enquiries can be directed to Mr Kelvin Soo (soo_kah_wai_kelvin@schools.gov.sg)

Annex A

CATEGORY A: SCIENCE AND/OR MATHEMATICS RESEARCH PROJECT

OVERVIEW: PARTICIPATION RULES AND REGULATIONS 
1.1 Primary research and/or secondary research may be conducted for Science and/or Mathematics Research Project. Primary Research is based on raw first-hand data collected by the researchers themselves. Secondary research involves the use of information gathered originally by primary research which is then further analysed.

1.2 Each project must be sponsored by a teacher and approved by the HOD. It is the responsibility of the teacher representatives and/or the HOD to ensure that the research project is carried out by student participants in a COVID-19 safe manner in accordance to the prevailing rules. Schools must ensure that the necessary precautions are carried out.

1.3 Both the synopsis and presentation deck must be submitted into the Google Drive folder designated to the school by the submission deadline, 14 March 2022 (Monday).

1.4 The Organisers reserve the right not to consider late entries.

  ELIGIBILITY
2.1 Teacher representatives must indicate if their students are competing in the Secondary School or Junior College (JC) category.

2.2 As a guideline, students who are still attending secondary school in 2022 must compete in the Secondary School category. Students who are attending JC or high school equivalent must compete in the JC category.

2.3 In the event that the team has a mixture of students from both groups, the team must compete in the JC category.

2.4 Registration of JC or high school equivalent students in the Secondary School category will result in disqualification. Please check with the Organisers if schools are unclear on the category.

2.5 If a school (such as Integrated Programme school) has projects in which some are undertaken by secondary school students, and others are undertaken by JC or high school equivalent students, the school can still only register a total maximum of five projects. Please register the projects under the correct categories.

  PROJECTS
3.1 Both the project synopsis and the presentation deck must be named with the assigned project code, and deposited in the Google Drive folder designated for the school.

3.2 The project synopsis is a concise summary of the project report which will be used by judges during pre-judging. The synopsis will not be judged. For the synopsis, submit a word or PDF document comprising of an abstract (100 to 200 words), keys steps in methods (100 to 200 words), results and discussion (300 to 500 words), and a conclusion (50 to 100 words).

3.3 The presentation deck should generally include:

Literature Review
Rationale of Research
Research Question, Hypothesis, and Expected Outcome(s)
Procedures or Methods
Results and Analysis
Impact or Application of Results
Bibliography
Students can use the sample presentation deck titled IEF 2022 Science Research Deck for reference, which can be found in https://tinyurl.com/23ElementzProjectTemplates.

3.4 If the research projects conducted involve animals and birds, please adhere to the rules regarding the care and use of animals for scientific purposes, as published on the website of The Animal & Veterinary Service (AVS) at

https://www.nparks.gov.sg/avs/resources/legislation/animals-and-birds-act-chapter-7

3.5 Most proposed research projects involving vertebrate animals and/or potentially hazardous biological agents must be reviewed and approved by the Scientific Review Committee (SRC) before experimentation. All proposed human research must be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) before experimentation begins. For more information, please visit

CATEGORY B: INNOVATION PROJECT (PROTOTYPE)

OVERVIEW: PARTICIPATION RULES AND REGULATIONS 
1.1 Each team proposes an idea or solution that can address a societal issue that your country is facing today or will face in the near future. The idea or solution should be in accordance to the theme: Sustainability.

1.2 Each project must be sponsored by a teacher and approved by the HOD. It is the responsibility of the teacher representatives and/or the HOD to ensure that the innovation project is carried out by student participants in a COVID-19 safe manner in accordance to the prevailing rules. Schools must ensure that the necessary precautions are carried out.

1.3 The presentation deck must be submitted into the Google Drive folder designated to the school by the submission deadline, 14 March 2021 (Monday).
