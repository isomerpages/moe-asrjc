### Science Research & Enrichment Programme

#### **SCIENCE RESEARCH PROGRAMME (SRP) 2022/23**

**ORGANISATION**

The Science Research Programme (SRP) was established in 1988 by the Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore (NUS) in collaboration with the Gifted Education Branch, Ministry of Education.  In the current cycle, mentors for the Programme come from the National University of Singapore’s Faculty of Science, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Faculty of Engineering, and Residential College 4; A*STAR’s Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (IBN), Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech), Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), NanoBio Lab; Cancer Science Institute of Singapore (CSI); Defence Science Organisation (DSO); Dunman High School; Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS); National Technological University (NTU); Raffles Science Institute (RSI); and Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).

 

**OBJECTIVE**

The main objective of the Programme is to give selected first-year Junior College/Year 5 Integrated Programme students who have demonstrated interest and aptitude for scientific research, the opportunity to be in a mentorship and undertake research projects in a scientific and technological community, acquiring critical inquiry and research competencies, and desirable dispositions of practitioners in the scientific field.

 

#### PROGRAMME

The Programme comprises 2 parts:

* Mentorship Attachment
* Science Research Congress
 

**The Mentorship Attachment** offers students the opportunity to work on research projects in Life/Medical Sciences, Chemical/Physical Sciences, and Engineering under the guidance of mentors from NUS and other established research centres.  Students work in a real-world research environment.

During the mentorship attachment in May/June, the student spends at least 2 weeks working full-time on the research project.

Thereafter, the student meets with the mentor on a regular basis to complete the research work.  Every student writes a scientific paper at the end of the Attachment.  The papers will be published as Proceedings of the 35th Science Research Congress.

 

**The Science Research Congress** which will be held in April 2023 offers students an opportunity to communicate their research findings to an audience of mentors and interested JC students.  On the successful completion of the Attachment, certificates of participation in the SRP 2022/23 will be presented to the students at the Congress.

Since 2006, the student in the SRP may submit his/her research project for assessment as a H3 subject.  Students offering H3-SRP would have to submit their scientific papers for H3 assessment in January 2023 and take part in an oral defence in late February 2023.

 

**ADMISSION CRITERIA**

Interested eligible JC1 H2 and Year 5 IP science students should first apply to participate in the Research Methods Module (RMM).

*Shortlisting criteria for participation in RMM*

About 120 students will be shortlisted for participation in the RMM based on:

* Strong academic performance;
* Interest demonstrated in scientific research-related activities in Secondary School; and
* JC or IP School Principal’s recommendation.


*Admission criteria to SRP 2022/23*

The admission criteria include:

* Successful completion of Research Methods Module (RMM),
* Attendance at the 34th Science Research Congress (online), and
* Acceptance of an approved Research Plan by a mentor.
