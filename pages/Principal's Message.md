Our college’s vision, **Imaginative Thinkers, Caring Leaders**, encapsulates the overall direction and purpose of ASRJC to develop the future leaders of our nation. Our students and alumni live by the college’s motto, **Discere Servire – Non Mihi Solum**, and that is To Learn, To Serve – Not for Myself Alone. They thrive in their learning, work and life, towards serving the local and global community as imaginative thinkers and caring leaders.

Student college life at ASRJC is enriching and fulfilling. Here, our students learn, play and forge strong and long-lasting friendships through wide-ranging programmes and college events. Our diverse college community is like a welcoming and warm second home to all, and that’s only possible with our caring and professional teaching, administrative and support staff, who are always ready to go the extra mile to care for and guide our students to achieve their aspirations.
