Students will be given opportunities to learn from the following three different disciplines: Languages; Humanities & the Arts; and Mathematics & Sciences. For instance, a Humanities/ Arts student will take at least one contrasting subject from the Mathematics and Sciences disciplines, and vice versa.

#### Project Work

**What is Project Work (PW)?**

*   It aims to provide students with the opportunity to explore the inter-relationships and inter-connectedness of subject-specific knowledge; encourages students to break away from compartmentalised learning, and to develop the ability to integrate information and make meaningful links between different strands of knowledge.
*   A group of 4 or 5 students will conduct a project based on the project task given (i.e. question), under the supervision of a supervising tutor.
*   PW is calculated as a H1 subject and thus the grading system is the same as other H1 subject (ie. A, B, C, D, E, S & U).

**What is the structure of PW?**
