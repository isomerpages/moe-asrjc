The ASRJC Shooting Team recently participated in the NSG Shooting Championships A Division 2019 from 1st to 5th April. Our shooters trained hard – pushing themselves further both mentally and physically, and helping one another stay focused, disciplined and resilient amid the many challenges.

They gave it their best shot – literally and figuratively – and did us proud!
