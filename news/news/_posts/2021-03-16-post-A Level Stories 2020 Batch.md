### Isabella Tiaras Cheng

![](/images/Alevel-2020-batch-2-300x300.png)

Isabella inspires those around her through her caring and selfless nature, demonstrated through her actions towards her friends and community.

Believing that every individual can be the change they want to see in the world, she has actively looked out for her classmates’ well-being and reached out to them to help them through their struggles. This was in spite of her juggling between her revision for her A-Level examination, a busy CCA schedule and some personal issues that she was managing at the time.

As President of the Students’ Council, she paid special attention to the character development of the councillors under her charge in Students’ Council, building in them the focus required to complete significant tasks and the communication skills required to mediate difficult conversations. 

She also gave back to the community during a project undertaken as part of the Alpha Program. The project gifted 280 frontline healthcare workers from Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic with hampers containing items to energise them and to show appreciation for their efforts as they continued to battle the COVD-19 crisis.

In ASRJC, her Class and Students’ Council Mentors, Ms Wong Kai Ning and Ms Cristee Koh respectively, were her pillars of support, turning to them for a listening ear in times of personal strife. Their small but powerful gestures of concern inspired her to ‘pay-it-forward’ and help those around her through their difficulties as well.

Isabella is considering a career in healthcare or foreign relations, and is exploring her options for a course in university.

All the best, Isabella!

### Ong Chee How

Chee How’s inquisitive mind sees no limit in Science and Mathematics, as he sees that there will always be new things to explore and new knowledge to be uncovered. 

His deep passion for Nanoscience motivated him to take part in the Science Research Programme organised by the National University of Singapore where he and his team researched Indium Oxide. Chee How and his team would eventually present their research at the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair, winning a Silver Award for their efforts. 

Chee How was also able to share his interest in the subject of robotics with his fellow CCA mates as the Head of Robotics, where he planned and conducted lessons and organised Robotics competitions for his fellow club members.

After having participated so actively in STEM-based activities, and having taken both Higher 2 Mathematics and Higher 2 Further Mathematics at the A-Levels, Chee How wishes to pursue a double major in Mathematics and Business Analytics at the National University of Singapore. If possible, he would like to further his studies by taking up a Master in Data Science and Machine Learning.

All the best, Chee How!

### Lim Wen Shu, Emily

Emily has a passion for Art and Literature. She believes both subjects are inextricably linked, and provide exciting perspectives with which to view life around her. She actively pursued her interests by taking these subjects at the H2 level for her A-Levels.

Pursuing her interests (cum studies) has not been without its challenges for Emily. Keeping up with the changes in her Art coursework proved difficult, and the Circuit Breaker also brought about issues when she had to share the space at home with her four brothers. 

Nonetheless, Emily overcame these challenges by being adaptable and flexible. She planned her revision schedule around her brothers’ timetables, and also reviewed the prioritisation of the topics for revision so that she would have ample space, time and bandwidth for revision. Her resourcefulness and determination enabled her to achieve the Best in Subject in H2 Art and H1 General Paper at the JC1 Promotional Examination as well as the Best in Subject in H1 Math in the JC2 Preliminary Examination. She also found time to participate in the Harvard Model Congress Asia as well as the Alpha Program.

Emily is looking to pursue writing as a career. As such, she hopes to explore different types of writing in university, such as screenplay and creative writing, to apply what she has learnt in Literature and Art thus far and to discover her personal writer’s voice. She is keen to take up a double major in English Literature and Art History.   

All the best, Emily!
