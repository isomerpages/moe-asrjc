8 students from our college were selected to take part in the 31st Singapore Physics Olympiad. This competition was jointly organised by the Institute of Physics, Singapore (IPS), the National University of Singapore (NUS), the National Institute of Education (NIE) and the Ministry of Education (MOE).Â The Theory Round took place on 20 Oct 2018 at NIE and Hu Yihong from class 19/25 was shortlisted to take part in the Experiment Round on 20 Nov 2018 at NUS. Eventually, Yihong was awarded and presented with the Silver Medal at the awards ceremony at SUTD on 14 Mar 2019.

Well done, Yihong!
