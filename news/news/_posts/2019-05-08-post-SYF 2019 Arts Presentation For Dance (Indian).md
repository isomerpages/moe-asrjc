It was a euphoric moment for our college when ASR TLDDS dance team was awarded the Certificate of Distinction in the SYF Indian Dance Presentation on Wednesday 24 April 2019.

Our dance item is titled Anwesha which means Quest. It is an arduous search for one’s true self in the process of overcoming the many dark challenges we face in our life journeys. Drawing inspiration from our ancient Sanskrit epic, Ramayana, these daily painful struggles we face are sensitively captured in our dance item where the Sitas, despite facing immense fears, bravely display a quiet defiance to face against the demonic Ravanas.
