This yearâ€™s Orientation took place from 29 January to 5 February. Despite the need to follow the Safe-distancing Management Measures, the Orientation was still an event that the freshmen enjoyed. This was thanks to the hard work and dedication put in by the Councillors and College Ambassadors who had planned and prepared for almost 4 months. Because of their efforts, the freshmen integrated seamlessly into College life, have an appreciation for the College culture, and have a sense of pride in being a part of a place that they could forge strong friendships and call home.
