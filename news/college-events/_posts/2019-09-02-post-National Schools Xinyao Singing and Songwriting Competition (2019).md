Huang Yihui and Feng Biaobiao from class 19/27 did the college proud by winning the 1st prize for the song writing (Open) category of the National Schools Xinyao Singing and Song Writing Competition (2019). 

“新空下” National Schools Xinyao Singing and Songwriting Competition is jointly organised by the Jurong Pioneer Junior College, Lianhe Zaobao and TCR Music Station. Through singing and composition of Xinyao songs, the competition aims to promote greater awareness and appreciation of Xinyao, and to ignite students’ interest in the Chinese Language. It is open to students from Secondary schools, JCs, CI, ITE, Polytechnics and local universities. The competition drew 270 participants in both the singing and songwriting categories this year. The audition, preliminary round and semi-finals were held from May to July 2019. 16 groups of finalists showcased their musical talent and creativity at the grand finals, which was held on 27 July 2019. 

Congratulations to the prizewinners!
