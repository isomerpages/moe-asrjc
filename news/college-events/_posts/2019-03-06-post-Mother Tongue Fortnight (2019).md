Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight aims to create an immersive environment for learning and appreciating Mother Tongue Languages and Cultures. Students are exposed to a wide variety of activities, such as Movie Appreciation, MICappella performance, cultural activities and workshops and Learning Journey and language games at our MTL booths. Through such activities we are able to create authentic and fun learning experiences that will help them appreciateÂ _Our Language, Our Culture: Our Living Heritage_.
