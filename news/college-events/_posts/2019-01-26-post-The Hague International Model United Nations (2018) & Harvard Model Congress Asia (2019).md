In November 2018 and January 2019 respectively, our students represented the college in two events. The Hague International Model United Nations (THIMUN) which was held at Hwa Chong Institution, and the Harvard Model Congress Asia (HMCA) which was organized by Harvard University and held at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Both these international events aimed to promote interaction and dialogue between young people from a variety of countries and school systems and to instill a global perspective in young people through the educational aims of Model United Nations, focusing on the formulation of peaceful resolutions to world problems.
