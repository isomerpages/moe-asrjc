##### Richmond Sin Jing Xuan (PDG 01/17)

Richmond was the President of the 34th AJC Students’ Council and displayed exemplary leadership and organisational qualities. This was especially evident in the conceptualising and implementing of the Joint Orientation in 2018, where the Students’ Councils of both AJC and SRJC collaborated for the first time ever to put together a week-long programme to welcome the first batch of students from ASRJC. Despite differences in culture, schedules and priorities across both colleges, Richmond approached the collaboration with humility, positivity and enthusiasm, and rallied his peers to focus on similarities rather than differences and work towards realising a common dream.

As a leader, Richmond was always mindful of his role in developing others. He values teamwork and often conducted meaningful debriefs and reflections to encourage the Student Council members to reflect and grow from their experiences. In his keenness to learn, he initiated and hosted a Council Sharing Session in 2017 with other colleges such as HCI, SAJC, RI and NYJC. Beyond the Student Council, Richmond played a key role in helping his team garner the top prize in the Science Category of the national Destination Imagination Tournament in 2018. Unfazed by the fact that he received nothing more than broad parameters at the start of the tournament, Richmond worked tirelessly with his fellow team members to explore options, facilitate discussions, and ultimately successfully complete the required tasks. A passionate leader, Richmond was awarded the Singapore Armed Forces Young Leaders Award and the Singapore Police Force Book Prize, and was a finalist in the National Young Leader’s Award in 2018.

Besides possessing strong leadership qualities, Richmond was an avid and humble learner as well. With a passion in serving the less fortunate, he hopes to pursue further studies in the field of medicine or pharmacy.

##### Ram Sunda Putra s/o Sangaran V (PDG 23/17)

An outstanding leader, Ram was the Vice-Captain of the Basketball Team in 2018 and the Captain of the Singapore Men’s Under-18 Basketball Team. In the National Schools ‘A’ Division Basketball Championships in 2017 and 2018, he led the team in clinching the championship twice in a row. Both years, he was also awarded the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award.

In recognition of his sporting excellence, Ram was also awarded the Singapore Schools Sports Council Colour Award in 2018. Despite the heavy commitments to his CCA, he works hard at his studies and helps out at his father’s hawker stall. With a heart for the community, Ram has also been coaching in the Kaixuan Basketball Programme, which caters to students with special needs in the community.

With a passion in sports, Ram intends to study sports science in NTU.

##### Wan Annissa Bte Saifullizan (CG 2SR01)

As Vice-President of the 30th Student Council of SRJC, Annissa played a pivotal role in facilitating the collaboration between student leaders from both AJC and SRJC to deliver their inaugural joint orientation experience. In spite of differences in culture, schedules and priorities across both colleges, Annissa, in her usual charismatic self, was able to convincingly, positively, and enthusiastically influence her peers to focus their energies on bringing together the strengths of both colleges. Mature beyond her years, she was able to deftly balance the need to confront the hard truths, but in a manner that was constructive and purposeful.

With a passion in languages and writing, she hopes to pursue a course in journalism or mass communications.
