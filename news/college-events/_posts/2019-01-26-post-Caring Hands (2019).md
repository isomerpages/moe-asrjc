“Caring Hands” is an initiative of the Character and Citizenship Department to gather the ASRJC community to express care and show responsibility for our immediate environment. It also aims to build our pride as a new merged college. It was held on the 9th of January for all JC2 students and Class Mentors. Classes were assigned to clean different venues in the college and Class Leaders led the classes effectively in dividing the various tasks. “Caring Hands” was a great opportunity to enhance bonding within classes and between classes and their Class Mentors. The programme also aims to enhance the sense of belonging to the college and to translate this into action at one level by keeping our learning environment clean. It is hoped that such care and service within the ASR community will inspire and nurture our young leaders to care for and serve the larger community in the future.
