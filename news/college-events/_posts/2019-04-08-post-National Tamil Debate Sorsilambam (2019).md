_Cheering for our friends!_

It was a proud moment for our college when our TLDDS debate team took part in the National Tamil Debate Sorsilambam 2019 Finals (for Junior Colleges, Polytechnics, Centralised Institutes and IB Institutions) which was spearheaded by the Tamil Language Council as part of the Tamil Language Festival 2019. This event was held on Saturday, 6 April 2019. Our debate team convincingly argued against its opponent team from Ngee Ann Polytechnic and emerged the winner! To add the icing on the cake, all four of our debaters won the Best Speaker Award in the various rounds of this competition, including our JC1 student, John Clement Melinda Joshal who clinched the Best Speaker Award in the finals! It is a strong affirmation for our college that Tamil as a mother tongue language is striving in our Tamil community. Citing the slogan of the Tamil Language Festival 2019, “Together, Let’s Love Tamil, Speak Tamil!”

The team, made up of Reddy Kannan Yugesh (19/36), Kavya Prabhakaran (20/31), Maria Immaculate (19/22) John Clement Melinda Joshal (20/35), E Abirramee (Reserve)(20/19), Jayakumar Aravindh (Reserve)(20/12) have done ASRJC proud. Well done!
