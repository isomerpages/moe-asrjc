On 3rd May, Stageworks proudly presented “Murder on the North-South Line”, an interactive drama whodunnit in which a man onboard an MRT train was inexplicably murdered. The audience was treated to an evening of mystery, excitement and comedy as they tried to figure out who the killer was. The Stagers have worked hard to write, cast and direct the play, and painstakingly designed and created the set. We hope the audience thoroughly enjoyed our performance!
