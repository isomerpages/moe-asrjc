The First Aid Competition challenges a team’s competency in first aid skills and knowledge in an unseen scenario under the pressure of time. This year, the team clinched a Silver. The ten-membered team was self-driven and highly motivated. Within a short training period of three weeks, they established a strong rapport and were focused on achieving their learning/training goals. Their commitment to the team led to a trusting environment where feedback were actively discussed, positively taken and acted upon. The team members frequently initiated additional training sessions to better one another’s identified areas of improvement and celebrated every small success together.
