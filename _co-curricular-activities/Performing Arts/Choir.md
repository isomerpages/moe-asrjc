<p>The Anderson Serangoon Junior College Choir is a vibrant ensemble of young
adult singers from diverse backgrounds. Under the guidance of Ms Angela
Lee, an experienced choral conductor, the Choir performs a wide repertoire
ranging from classical masterpieces to contemporary pop arrangements. We
rehearse twice weekly, honing our skills in vocal technique, sight-reading,
and ensemble performance. The Choir regularly participates in the biennial
Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentations, in addition to holding our
public concert in every alternate year. We also contribute to college life
by performing at school events. With our motto of “Simul Harmonia”, the
Choir experience not only develops our members’ musical abilities but also
fosters teamwork, discipline and leadership skills.</p>
