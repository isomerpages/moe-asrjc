<p>The Anderson Serangoon Junior College Chinese Orchestra (ASRCO) is led
by the conductor, Mr Ng Seng Hong. The orchestra has consistently attained
the Certificate of Distinction at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation
for Chinese Orchestra, through the dedication, hard work, and musical excellence
of their members.</p>
<p>In ASRCO, members are given many opportunities to promote Chinese music
and culture, both within the school and in the broader community. Through
performances at major events like the Chinese New Year (CNY) Celebration
and their Biennial Concert, the orchestra plays an important role in fostering
cultural appreciation and engagement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASRCO’s repertoire is wide-ranging, covering both traditional Chinese
pieces and more contemporary compositions, ensuring that the orchestra’s
performances remain exciting and relevant in today’s society. In addition
to their musical development, members are encouraged to build meaningful
relationships with peers from other schools through school exchanges. These
exchanges provide a chance for members to interact with fellow musicians,
broaden their cultural horizons, and form lasting friendships that extend
beyond the college.</p>
<p>At the end of their journey in ASRCO, members leave with cherished memories
of their time in the orchestra, having built strong bonds with one another.
They also walk away with valuable life lessons, including discipline, resilience,
and the importance of teamwork.</p>
