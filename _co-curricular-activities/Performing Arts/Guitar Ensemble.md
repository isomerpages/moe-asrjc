<p>ASR Guitar Ensemble aims to develop the students’ musical knowledge and
guitar skills, as well as to grow their creativity and teamwork. Our motto
“Six Strings One Sound” encompasses the ensemble’s core values of collaboration
and communication among the members. Our ensemble adopts the Niibori method
originated from Japan, with the variety of guitars that follows that of
an orchestra: the Alto, Prime, Bass, Contrabass and Guitarron. Under the
guidance of our veteran instructors, our members are exposed to a wide
range of genres of songs, from the timeless classical to contemporary hits.</p>
<p>ASR Guitar Ensemble participates in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF)
Arts Presentation biennially. Despite many members having no prior guitar
knowledge, they master the skills within a year and perform commendably
at the SYF. During the non-SYF years, the ensemble showcases a wide repertoire
of songs at the ASR Guitar Ensemble Concert. Our members also have opportunities
to perform during the college’s significant events such as the Open House.
Beyond the stage, the ensemble participates in the Service-learning Projects
in which the members use their musical talents to make a positive impact
on the community. Through the bonding activities, a culture of care is
fostered and the camaraderie among the members is strengthened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASR Guitar Ensemble exemplifies the growth mindset among the members,
and creates an unforgettable memory in one’s JC experience.</p>
