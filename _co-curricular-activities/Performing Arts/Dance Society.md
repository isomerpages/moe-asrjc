<p>The Dance CCA is a vibrant and transformative program that nurtures inclusivity,
resilience, and passion for the art of movement. With a primary focus on
Contemporary Dance, the CCA welcomes students with varying levels of experience,
providing opportunities to grow both as individuals and as performers.
Under the guidance of our esteemed instructor, Mr. Goh Shou Yi, students
receive specialized training in Contemporary Dance. Students may also be
exposed to other genres such as Street Jazz and Hip Hop.</p>
<p>More than just a platform for artistic expression, the Dance CCA fosters
holistic development by combining elements of sports and performing arts.
Members undergo physical training to build stamina and strength, alongside
learning about body anatomy to enhance their performance and prevent injuries.
The rigorous process builds mental fortitude, reflecting the timeless adage, <em>"Ten Years Of Work For Every Minute On Stage."</em>
</p>
<p>Students have the opportunity to either represent the school at the Singapore
Youth Festival or take center stage by organizing a full-scale dance concert.
Members also explore their creativity by choreographing original routines
for the school’s events and they are given opportunities to appreciate
professional dance concerts, broadening their perspectives and deepening
their understanding of Contemporary Dance. Leadership development is another
key aspect of the Dance CCA, with students taking charge of events such
as Values-in-Action (VIA) projects, building essential teamwork and organizational
skills.</p>
<p>Training sessions are held twice weekly, focusing on mastering dance routines,
enhancing physical strength, and deepening knowledge of dance techniques
and body anatomy to promote safe practices.</p>
<p>Through rigorous training, creative expression, and leadership opportunities,
the Dance CCA fosters discipline, confidence, and a strong sense of community.
Members embark on a journey of self-discovery, emerging as well-rounded
individuals who excel both on stage and in life.</p>
