<p>Volleyball is a dynamic team sport that fosters both mental and physical
strength in students. It offers a unique opportunity to challenge personal
limits, build resilience, and develop a strong sense of camaraderie among
teammates. The Volleyball CCA is dedicated to creating a culture of excellence
that extends beyond the court, helping students grow into confident, disciplined
individuals. Throughout the year, the CCA engages students with exciting
activities, including weekly training sessions, inter-school competitions,
and recreational outings. We have also been fortunate to participate in
cultural exchanges, such as the ASReXplore trip to Thailand, where we deepened
our understanding of our ASEAN neighbors through historical site visits
to understand their culture and heritage value, not to forget our friendly
matches. We take pride in our hard-earned victories in the National School
Games, including a 3rd place finish by the A Division girls in 2022 and
a 4th place finish in 2024, and a 4th place finish by the A Division boys
in 2019.</p>
