<p>strategy. Our Touch Rugby programme is designed for students of all skill
levels, including those with no prior experience in the sport. All that
is required is a strong desire to achieve your personal best and work cohesively
as a team both on and off the field.</p>
<p>Students will engage in weekly training sessions conducted by an experienced
coach, who is supported by a team of dedicated teachers. These sessions
provide a structured and nurturing environment where students can develop
their technical skills, tactical awareness, and physical fitness. Beyond
individual growth, these sessions are a platform to foster camaraderie,
sportsmanship, and resilience.</p>
<p>To sharpen their skills and build bonds, students participate in friendly
matches with other schools. These friendlies not only enhance their game
understanding but also instill a sense of community and mutual respect.
For those aspiring to push their limits further, our team competes in regional
and national competitions. These events offer invaluable exposure and the
opportunity to measure progress against some of the best teams in the country.</p>
<p>The Touch Rugby programme also places a strong emphasis on personal leadership.
Students are encouraged to take on leadership roles, such as team captains
or peer mentors, fostering qualities like responsibility, communication,
and decision-making. This holistic approach ensures that our players grow
not just as athletes but as individuals capable of leading and inspiring
others.</p>
<p>Whether you are a seasoned player or a complete beginner, our Touch Rugby
programme offers an exciting journey of self-discovery, growth, and achievement.
Join us and experience the thrill of the game while creating lasting memories
with your teammates!</p>
