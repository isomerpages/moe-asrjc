<p>Anderson Serangoon Taekwondo (ASR TKD) is a sports Co-Curricular Activity
(CCA) where students perform Poomsae patterns of varying difficulty levels
based on the colour of our belts, ranging from white to black. With every
test known as grading, we attain a new belt level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASR TKD’s motto, "Team above Self," prioritizes the group’s success over
individual recognition, fostering collaboration and shared responsibility.
This creates a supportive, unified environment built on trust, respect,
and belonging. Emphasizing team spirit, ASR TKD strengthens bonds within
the team, helping everyone work together towards common goals and greater
achievements.</p>
<p>ASR TKD promotes core values of respect, resilience, humility, and discipline
to create a positive, motivating environment. Respect builds trust and
communication, supporting growth in sports and life. Humility fosters self-improvement,
while confidence helps overcome self-doubt. Discipline encourages self-directed
learning, where members take responsibility for their development through
practice and collaboration. At ASR TKD, excellence is driven by personal
commitment, continuous learning, and the desire to improve, both as athletes
and individuals.</p>
<p>Each year, our Team participates in the National School Games(NSG). Additionally,
we also take part in Pesta Sukan and Nanyang Technological University Taekwondo
Open Championship, allowing students to gain experience and learn beyond
training sessions. In 2024, the CCA achieved an overall 4th placement in
NSG “A” division for girls and achieved many individual podium placings.
In 2023, ASR TKD achieved overall second place in NSG “A” division for
girls and third place for NSG “A” division for boys.</p>
<p>Beyond competitions, we embraced the challenge of mastering Poomsae performance.
For Open House 2025, we pushed our limits by showcasing a freestyle poomsae
that included basic kicks, complex 360 turning kicks, and intricate patterns.
This performance was a testament to our team's dedication to stretching
our potential and taking on new challenges. It highlighted not only the
skill and discipline required but also the excitement and fun that comes
with pushing ourselves to excel. By stepping outside our comfort zones,
we demonstrated the value of growth and embracing new experiences in our
Taekwondo journey.</p>
<p>ASR TKD is committed to giving back to the community through Service Learning
Projects. In 2024, we had the privilege of visiting Pertapis Children’s
Home, where we shared our Taekwondo knowledge and spread joy. Throughout
the session, our team demonstrated patience and empathy in communicating
with the children, recognizing the importance of listening and understanding
their needs. We approached the experience with humility, focusing not on
personal recognition but on making a positive impact and fostering a sense
of connection and joy with others. This initiative reflects our commitment
to service and continuous personal growth.</p>
