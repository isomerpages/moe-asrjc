<p>The ASR Netball Team is a dynamic and driven group of student-athletes
united by a shared passion for Netball. With a clear vision to strive for
excellence underpinned by strong team unity and training ethos, the ASR
Netball Team is dedicated to achieving greatness both on and off the court.</p>
<p>At the heart of the team's purpose is a commitment to providing a supportive
and inclusive environment where members can develop their skills, ignite
their passion for Netball, and foster enduring friendships and strong character.
Through their participation in the CCA, members are encouraged to embody
values such as tenacity, empathy, and sportsmanship.</p>
<p>The CCA’s key activity is competing in the SSSC National School Games
Netball National 'A' Division Championships, where they face off against
top teams from other schools in their age group. This tournament provides
the perfect platform for the ASR Netball Team to showcase their skills,
determination, and team spirit. Beyond the championships, the ASR Netball
Team also participates in a range of activities that broaden their learning
experience and provide opportunities for growth. These include the Deloitte
Pesta Sukan Netball Competition, which fosters teamwork and healthy competition,
as well as the team’s annual Service Learning Project, where team members
give back to the community and in the process, develop essential life skills.
Additionally, members help to plan and organise activities such as Inter-house
games, Open House, and CCA Bazaar. Through these diverse experiences, every
member of the ASR Netball Team has the chance to develop new skills, build
lasting relationships, and create unforgettable memories.</p>
<p>With their vision, purpose, and values guiding them, the ASR Netball Team
is poised to make their mark on the court!</p>
