<p>The ASR Football CCA is a dynamic and inclusive programme that helps students
improve their skills in technique, strategy, and teamwork. It provides
an opportunity for students to cultivate resilience, focus, and sportsmanship
while fostering camaraderie through a common love for the sport. As an
integral part of the school’s sports community, the ASR Football CCA not
only refines technical abilities and builds physical resilience but also
develops character, confidence, and a competitive mindset among its members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout the year, the ASR Football CCA provides a range of exciting
activities, such as weekly training sessions led by experienced coaches
to enhance players' skills and tactical knowledge. Members also engage
in inter-school friendly matches and the internal ASR League (an annual
intra-CCA football tournament), all within a supportive and encouraging
environment. There are ample opportunities for members to develop leadership
skills through involvement in organising key CCA events, including the
Open House, CCA Bazaar, Selection Trials, March Holiday Camp, and JC2 Farewell.
Additionally, members have the opportunity to showcase their footballing
skills and compete at the highest level by representing the school at the
prestigious National School Games.</p>
