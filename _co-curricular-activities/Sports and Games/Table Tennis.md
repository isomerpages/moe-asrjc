<p>Our training sessions are on every Tuesday and Thursdays 5.30pm to 7.30pm,
with an additional session on SDL days as we approach the National School
Games (NSG) season. We kick off each session with warm-ups to ensure players
are prepared for the physical demands of the sport. From there, we dive
into focused drills that are designed to enhance key skills such as service,
attack and defense.</p>
<p>We end off each session by having friendly matches within the team. These
matches allow players to apply what theyâ€™ve learned in a real-game setting,
helping them to improve their strategies and gain confidence.</p>
<p>Our coach is hands-on, offering guidance and personalized feedback, ensuring
that every player, regardless of experience, has the chance to improve.
This way, we foster a team environment where everyone can improve together
and no one is left behind.</p>
<p>We compete against other colleges in NSG, giving us the chance to test
ourselves at a higher level and continue evolving as players. These experiences
push us to raise our standards, build resilience, and refine our skills
under pressure.</p>
<p>In addition, we partake in youth-led service learning projects, helping
the community, elderly as well as those in need.</p>
<p>The key strength of our Table Tennis CCA is our team spirit. Beyond training,
we have regular bonding activities like team dinners or casual outings
that help foster friendships and create a peaceful and unique atmosphere.</p>
<p>United by our passion and team spirit, we thrive together through rigorous
training, friendly matches, and meaningful community engagement, allowing
our journey in ASR Table Tennis to be an unforgettable and enriching journey.</p>
