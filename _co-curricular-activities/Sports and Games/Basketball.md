<p>The Basketball CCA is committed to fostering both athletic excellence
and strong character and values in its members. In our CCA programme, we
emphasise the values of Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity,
Care, and Harmony, supporting the development of our students to be well-rounded
individuals both on and off the court. These core values guide our training,
interactions, and engagements, shaping our players into respectful and
responsible team members.</p>
<p>We believe in providing a breadth of experiences that ensure holistic
development of our members. Our training sessions are structured to promote
progression and growth, enabling members to develop fundamental and advanced
basketball skills. To keep our members motivated, we introduce challenging
yet enjoyable experiences, pushing them to improve while maintaining their
passion for the game.</p>
<p>The Basketball CCA offers numerous opportunities for members to grow in
their leadership and teamwork. We emphasise self-leadership and encourage
members to develop self-awareness, self-management, and accountability
in their actions. Furthermore, students learn team leadership by practicing
communication, collaboration, and through inspiring each other towards
common goals. These skills not only benefit performance on the court but
also prepare our members for future leadership roles beyond school.</p>
<p>Beyond the game, we emphasise the importance of giving back. Our CCA promotes
and participates in service-learning activities. Through meaningful community
engagements, members apply their values, knowledge, and skills to benefit
society. Students take ownership of their contributions and reflect on
their experiences, ensuring continuous personal growth and a lifelong commitment
to making a positive impact.</p>
<p>The Basketball CCA is more than just a sports team. It is a community
dedicated to character building, skill enhancement, leadership, and meaningful
contributions beyond the CCA.</p>
