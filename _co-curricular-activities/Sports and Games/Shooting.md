<p>Shooting is more than just pulling a trigger; it is a discipline that
demands fortitude, patience and perseverance. Every shot is a test of mental
and physical acuity. It requires sharp focus, steady hands and a calm mind,
all of which are essential traits for success both on and off the range.</p>
<p>Our college shooting team has proven its mettle on the national stage
and has produced gold, silver and bronze individual and team medalists
in the discipline of 10m Air-Rifle and 10m Air-Pistol over the past 3 years.
These achievements reflect the hard work, unwavering focus and spirit of
camaraderie of our shooters, showing that with perseverance and collective
commitment, success is always within reach.</p>
<p>The sports of shooting continues to shape our students into disciplined
and determined individuals, ready to take on any challenges.</p>
