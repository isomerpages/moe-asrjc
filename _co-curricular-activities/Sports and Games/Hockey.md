<p>The Anderson Serangoon Junior College Hockey team offers a unique opportunity
for students from diverse backgrounds to develop not just physically, but
also mentally, as they grow into stronger, more resilient individuals.
As much as Hockey is about physical endurance, it is equally about mental
toughness. The CCA helps build tenacity, teaching students to stay focused
under pressure and to bounce back from setbacks. It also instills a sense
of purpose as the teams work together to achieve common goals, building
leadership qualities, and a mindset that thrives on overcoming challenges.
Every practice and match pushes students to be better, both in terms of
their physical capabilities and their mental strength.</p>
<p>As part of the Hockey team, students will have the opportunity to take
part in friendly inter-school matches, represent the college in national
competitions such as the National School Games and the National Junior
League, give back to the community through Service Learning projects and
travel overseas to learn from other athletes from different socio-cultural
backgrounds. Whether you are new to the sport or an experienced player,
Hockey provides an opportunity to build lifelong friendships, challenge
yourself, and represent the college with pride.</p>
