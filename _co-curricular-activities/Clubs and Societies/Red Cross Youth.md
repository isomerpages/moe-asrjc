<p>Red Cross Youth(RCY) embodies the value of “Humanity in Our Hands”, setting
the foundation for many young talents to develop compassion and a sense
of responsibility. Our CCA has been actively involved in a wide range of&nbsp;
first aid duties, as well as educating our peers on basic first aid. Through
these hands-on experiences together with our participation in First Aid
certification courses, our members have honed their first aid skills and
grown confident in responding to unexpected situations. A noteworthy mention
would be one of our members stepping up to assist in a cardiac arrest case
in their neighborhood, providing crucial early support. This act of humanity
aligns with our Red Cross promise to join with others all over the world
to help the sick and the suffering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delving into the key activities carried out by our CCA, we organise the
annual Blood Donation Drive carried out in our college, collaborating with
Singapore Red Cross Society and Health Science Authority. Red Cross Youth
partnered with Sheng Hong Student Care Centre for our Service Learning
project where we taught primary school students about the importance of
First Aid and basic treatments through interactive games. Additionally,
we were featured on the Red Cross Youth page for our inspirational first
aid video, raising awareness about the importance of safe play. At Red
Cross Youth, we are committed to nurture compassionate, skilled individuals
who embody the spirit of humanity in action.</p>
