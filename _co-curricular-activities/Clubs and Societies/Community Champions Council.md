<p>The Community Champions Council (CCC) stands as a beacon of service and
leadership, guided by the motto: serve with passion, lead with compassion.
With a strong emphasis on both outreach and leadership, CCC fosters holistic
development, nurturing essential values such as care, compassion, and empathy.
These values inspire its members (Community Champions) and their peers
to serve and make a tangible difference in society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of CCC’s most anticipated events is <em>ASRGives</em>, which takes
place during JC1 Orientation. This initiative provides an opportunity for
incoming students to venture into the community, serving those in need
while spreading the festive joy of New Year. For many students, this experience
proved to be transformative by deepening their understanding of the significance
of community service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another key event in CCC's calendar is <em>ASRConnects</em>, a school-wide
initiative that broke new ground by hosting elderly members from local
active ageing centres to the school to celebrate National Day. This event
was curated to bring smiles and create memories for the elderly, further
strengthening the bond between the school and the community. Mental well-being
also holds a special place within CCC’s mission. Through <em>Mental Wellness Week</em>,
CCC focuses on fostering a supportive environment for all by encouraging
an open dialogue around mental wellness.</p>
<p>In addition, CCC maintains a strong commitment to its regular outreach
partners by reaching out to long-standing partners such as the Active Ageing
Centre (Jia Ying AAC), Cheshire Home, and the Institute of Mental Health
once every fortnight. These interactive visits aim to strengthen the bonds
between Community Champions and the community.</p>
<p>Over time, Community Champions experience personal growth and make positive
changes within the community. Through these efforts, CCC not only serves
and leads, but also cultivates a sense of empathy and responsibility that
extends far beyond the walls of the school.</p>
