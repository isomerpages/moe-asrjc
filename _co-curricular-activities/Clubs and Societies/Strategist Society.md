<p>The Strategist Society focuses on international chess, designed to develop
critical thinking, strategic decision-making and problem-solving skills
among students. This CCA offers a platform for students to sharpen their
thinking skills while fostering discipline, concentration, and teamwork.
The primary purpose of the Strategist Society is to help students learn
chess and nurture a love for the game. The CCA envisions empowering students
to be strategic thinkers and promote chess as a valuable skill that encourages
mental agility and persistence.</p>
<p>Activities within the Strategist Society include regular chess training
sessions, hosting chess tournaments for the cohort and participation in
inter-school chess competitions. The CCA encourages a culture of peer-to-peer
coaching, where experienced student coaches mentor newer members, sharing
strategies and techniques. This collaborative approach allows both the
mentor and mentee to growâ€”coaches refine their own understanding of the
game by teaching others, while mentees gain new insights and tactics from
their peers. Hosting internal tournaments and friendly matches within the
CCA allows students to compete against each other which encourages healthy
competition and provides a valuable opportunity for students to test and
refine new tactics in real-time, learning from both successes and mistakes.</p>
