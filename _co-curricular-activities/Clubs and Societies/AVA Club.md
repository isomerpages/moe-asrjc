<p>Welcome to the AVA Club, where our motto is <em>“Inspiring Creativity, Capturing Every Moment.”</em> At
AVA, we bring events to life, transform ideas into reality, and preserve
memories with passion and precision. From storytelling to advanced media
production, we create moments that resonate and last a lifetime.</p>
<p>As the backbone of school events, we ensure seamless sound and lighting
for festive celebrations, concerts, and sound management for daily morning
assemblies. Beyond technical support, we actively contribute to school
publicity by creating video projects for events like iHeart Run, Mother
Tongue Fortnight, and the International Elementz Fair in 2024. Our <em>People of ASR</em> video
series, DSA promotional videos, and Canva graphic designs for past school
events further showcase the vibrant spirit of our school community.</p>
<p>During CCA sessions, held on Mondays from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM and Wednesdays
from 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM, members receive audio-visual training, including
sound, lighting, and projector operations from Mr. Lim and peer-led sessions.
Videography and video editing skills are developed through peer-led workshops
and external vendors. Regular technical training and assessment sessions,
conducted by our own team members, ensure that our skills remain top-notch
and ready to support school events. Occasionally, projects may require
additional time outside sessions, but the outcomes are deeply rewarding.
Mr. Yeong, our teacher-in-charge, provides consistent and constructive
feedback on our CCA session plans and media projects, driving continuous
improvement.</p>
<p>At AVA, we value passion, humility, respect, and empathy. We believe that
only when members are open to feedback and treat others with respect can
they truly learn and grow. These values form the foundation of our team’s
success and collaboration.</p>
<p>Our journey includes exciting opportunities, such as visiting Zing Media
for hands-on film production and exploring professional audio-visual setups
at The Star Theatre. Additionally, we showcase our creativity through competitions
like the Schools Digital Media Awards (SDMA), where we proudly won 1st
Prize for our NEA Public Hygiene campaign video</p>
<p>No prior experience is required to join us. Through student-led workshops
and professional training, our members develop essential skills, grow as
individuals, and make meaningful contributions to the school and community.
If you’re ready to learn, create, and make an impact, we warmly invite
you to join the AVA Club. Together, we celebrate teamwork, creativity,
and service.</p>
