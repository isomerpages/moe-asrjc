<p>Welcome to the AVA Club, where our motto is <em>‚ÄúInspiring Creativity, Capturing Every Moment.‚Äù</em> At
AVA, we bring events to life, transform ideas into reality, and preserve
memories with passion and precision. From storytelling to advanced media
production, we create moments that resonate and last a lifetime.</p>
<p>As the backbone of school events, we ensure seamless sound and lighting
for festive celebrations, concerts, and daily morning assemblies. Beyond
technical support, we actively contribute to school publicity by producing
engaging video projects for events such as the <strong>iHeart Run, Mother Tongue Fortnight, and the International Elementz Fair in 2024</strong>.
Our <strong>People of ASR video series, DSA promotional videos, and Canva graphic designs</strong> further
showcase the vibrant spirit of our school community.</p>
<h3>Championing Creativity: Our Win in 2024</h3>
