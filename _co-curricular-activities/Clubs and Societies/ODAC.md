<p><strong>ASR ODAC: Embark on an enriching Outdoor Adventure!</strong>
</p>
<p>Looking for a CCA that challenges you physically and mentally while fostering
teamwork and leadership? Join ASR ODAC (Outdoor Activities Club)‚Äîwhere
adventure meets responsibility!</p>
<p>At ASR ODAC, we believe in our vision: ‚ÄúBe a Land Master, Be a Sea Conqueror.‚Äù
Through our activities, students develop the BRAVO spirit‚ÄîBrave, Resourceful,
Adventurous, Versatile, and Outgoing. More than just essential qualities
for any outdoor enthusiast, these traits are highly relevant in today‚Äôs
world. Whether navigating complex challenges, adapting to new environments,
or leading in a fast-changing society, the BRAVO spirit equips students
with resilience, creativity, and confidence. These qualities empower them
to tackle academic, professional, and personal challenges with a growth
mindset.</p>
<p>Our members take charge of planning and executing weekly sessions and
major events*, under the guidance of our dedicated CCA teachers. They must
consider safety, well-being, and growth‚Äîboth their own and their peers‚Äô‚Äîas
they design activities that test their skills and adaptability. As they
execute their plans, students develop critical thinking and problem-solving
abilities, making real-time decisions in response to changing weather,
time constraints, and sometimes unforeseen challenges.</p>
<p>ASR ODAC members gain hands-on experience in a wide range of outdoor skills,
including first aid, orienteering, knots and lashing, outdoor cooking,
kayaking, and physical conditioning. These skills prepare them for exciting
adventures such as pioneering, orienteering competitions, camping at Pulau
Ubin, night cycling, kayaking and trekking trips.</p>
<p>Whether you're a seasoned outdoor enthusiast or someone looking to step
out of your comfort zone, ASR ODAC offers a platform to challenge yourself,
build resilience, and forge lasting friendships. So why wait? Join us and
embark on an unforgettable journey of adventure and growth!</p>
<p>*Major events usually take place on weekends as they require more time
and start in the morning.&nbsp;</p>
