<p>The Chinese Language Drama and Debate Society (CLDDS) is a platform for
students to share their passion for Chinese theatre. Through exposure to
theatre, members gain numerous opportunities to build confidence and explore
new possibilities. Weekly drama lessons provide a strong foundation for
members to hone their acting skills, which are then showcased during the
Society’s annual production. Beyond acting, members gain hands-on experience
in stage management, professional sound and lighting design, and props
and costume creation, fostering a holistic understanding of theatre production.
During weekly activities, members bond through engaging drama modules,
skits, and performance planning, creating a close-knit community within
the CCA.</p>
<p>In 2024, CLDDS represented the college at the Singapore Youth Festival
(SYF) with a performance titled A Perfect (Meta) Life, a thought-provoking
exploration of life’s meaning and purpose. Despite challenges such as limited
resources and actors with varying levels of experience, the team remained
resilient and focused on delivering a great performance. With the careful
guidance of teachers and instructors, CLDDS clenched a Certificate of Distinction
at SYF 2024—a testament to their hard work and teamwork.</p>
<p>Later that year, CLDDS performed at Hougang CC’s National Day Dinner.
The team adapted and presented a play about the Samsui women, honoring
the Merdeka generation and their contributions to building modern Singapore.
This heartfelt tribute earned them a token of appreciation from Hougang
CC, adding to their repertoire of enriching experiences.</p>
<p>If you share a passion for theatre arts and wish to grow both on and off
the stage, join the CLDDS family and embark on an inspiring journey in
the performing arts!</p>
