<p>The Students’ Council drives the college spirit through organising events
such as the Freshmen Orientation, Teachers’ Day Celebrations and Movie
Night. As leaders elected by students from their respective Houses, the
councillors also organise initiatives such as Trash-to-Treasure and Free
Play that provide platforms to participate in college life and to build
memories together.&nbsp;</p>
