<p>The Visual Art Club (VA) provides a creative sanctuary for ASRJC students
to express their imagination, hone artistic skills, and foster a deeper
appreciation for the visual arts. Open to all students, the club aims to
nurture talents, encourage experimentation, and build a vibrant community
of budding artists.
<br>
<br>Our activities are designed to inspire and challenge students, ranging
from hands-on workshops to participation in art competitions. Last year,
members explored diverse techniques through watercolour and pottery workshops,
cultivating a blend of traditional and contemporary art forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>VA has also made its mark through remarkable achievements over the past
few years.These include clinching awards at prestigious competitions such
as the 13-19 Art Prize, the Schools Digital Media Awards and the National
Day Giveaway, organised by the Singapore Art Museum. These achievements
reflect the vibrant creativity and commitment to excellence that define
our CCA.</p>
<p>Beyond competitions, VA plays a vital role in enriching the school’s culture.
Our members contribute to school-wide events, creating meaningful and inspiring
visual pieces that reflect the community's values and aspirations. Our
annual college event, the ASRJC Art Fest, seeks to increase the awareness
and appreciation for the visual arts among our college community and beyond
through a variety of hands-on art fringe activities. It also provides a
platform for our VA members to showcase their artistic talents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through these experiences, VA continues to be a cornerstone of artistic
development, instilling confidence and creativity in its members.</p>
