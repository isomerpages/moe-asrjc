<p>Each student attended two talks, where they received valuable advice and
insights. A key message was the importance of not being afraid to be passionate
about their interests. Speakers emphasised that pursuing genuine passions
is crucial for long-term success and satisfaction. When making university
choices, students were advised to make informed decisions by considering
factors including finance, personal interests and location.</p>
<p>Students also learned about differences between universities, such as
class sizes and opportunities for overseas exchanges that are valuable
for personal growth and global exposure. Speakers encouraged students to
investigate all options thoroughly and to draw from personal experiences
when telling their stories, as these narratives can be powerful and authentic.</p>

<p>At the same time, the foyer was a bustling hub of information and networking,
with booths from the aforementioned institutes, educational consultancy
organisations from the US, UK, and Australia, and the Ministry of National
Development (MND). Each student visited booths of their choice, delving
deeper into specific interests or queries.</p>

<p>Students were reminded that they should not fear trying because they may
never know their true capabilities until they try. A recurrent theme was
the courage to try new things, discovering true potential through exploration
and effort.</p>
