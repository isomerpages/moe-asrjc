<p>At the heart of ASR’s vibrant arts scene stands <strong>Thaqif</strong>,
a dynamic individual whose passion for theatre, leadership, and community
shines through his every endeavour. As the student director and actor for
Literature Night 2024, he took on the challenge of directing for the first
time, seamlessly blending creative vision with technical execution. From
curating dramatic acts to managing lighting, props, and staging, Thaqif’s
dedication brought the showcase to life, captivating audiences and leaving
a lasting impact.</p>
<p>Thaqif’s leadership extended beyond the stage, as he actively fostered
camaraderie within his team during Literature Night 2024. His dedication
to supporting others was equally evident in his role as a College Ambassador
during Orientation 2024, where he warmly welcomed new students and helped
them transition smoothly into JC life.</p>
<p>With aspirations to study social science, Thaqif is eager to deepen his
understanding of humanity and global issues. As he prepares for National
Service, he remains committed to lifelong learning, immersing himself in
readings that broaden his perspectives.</p>
<p>Thaqif, the #asrfamily is cheering you on! We can’t wait to see where
your journey takes you next.
