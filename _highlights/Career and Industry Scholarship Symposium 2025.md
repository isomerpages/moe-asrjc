<p>The Career &amp; Industry Scholarship Symposium was an enriching experience
for our JC1 and JC2 students. They had the opportunity to hear from professionals
across 15 diverse industries, ranging from Sustainability to Law and Allied
Health. Many of the speakers were proud alumni of ASRJC or supportive members
of the Parent Support Group (PSG), who generously shared their experiences
and insights.</p>
