The Class of 2022 went through a rollercoaster ride as they saw the transition to a post-Covid college environment. ASRJC’s annual Homecoming 2023: The Reunion was a hugely welcomed and highly anticipated event not just for the class of 2022, but also for the previous batches who were severely affected by the Covid restrictions. During the event on 06 May, participants reminisced their past experiences in ASRJC and celebrated their achievements as proud alumni of ASRJC.

We began the day with our annual awards ceremony for the class of 2022, presenting the academic and non-academic awards to our outstanding alumni. We were honoured to have our invited guests, Ms Low Yoke Kiew, Zonal Director Schools North, Mdm Chilukuri Dimps Rao, N5 Cluster Superintendent, Mdm Ham Yuen Ching,  Chairperson of our Parents Support Group, and Mr Fang Koh Look, Chairman of the College Advisory Committee grace the ceremony.  It was also a true homecoming for our former Vice Principal, Mdm Low Bee Yen and our former Principal, Mr Manogaran Suppiah.

The MOE Service to Education Award was presented to the College Advisory Committee, whose members have come forward voluntarily to support our college programmes and promote students’ wellbeing. The ceremony also saw the naming of the valedictorian for the class of 2022 – Erin Ashley Wan from Class 22/08, who also received the Discere Sevire – Non Mihi Solum award.

The campus bustled with joyous energy as alumni returned to our campus for a memorable event. The day was a delightful blend of nostalgia and new experiences, offering a variety of activities for everyone. In the 'Leave Your Mark' activity hosted in the Nexus, attendees commemorated the heritage of ASRJC, AJC, and SRJC by painting tiles that would eventually come together as a collage. In the library, the 'Memory Lane' activity invited participants to reminisce their time in the college through yearbooks and videos. The campus was also adorned with sticker collection stations, allowing participants to create a layout map of the ASR campus as a memorabilia of their favorite spots that would soon be rebuilt as the campus enters reconstruction in 2024. The Photographic Society showcased an exhibition capturing 'A Day in the Life of ASR'. Alumni and staff joining the day's activities with their families spent time in the Kids Play Room which provided child-friendly activities. Added in to the mix by the Homecoming Student Planning Committee were shrink plastic crafts and mini-games that catered to participants of various interests. The canteen and the Hall came alive with live performances by CCAs and student groups, infusing the air with celebratory vibes.
