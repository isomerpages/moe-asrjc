The Class of 2022 went through a rollercoaster ride as they saw the transition to a post-Covid college environment. ASRJCâ€™s annual Homecoming 2023: The Reunion was a hugely welcomed and highly anticipated event not just for the class of 2022, but also for the previous batches who were severely affected by the Covid restrictions. During the event on 06 May, participants reminisced their past experiences in ASRJC and celebrated their achievements as proud alumni of ASRJC.

The campus buzzed with nostalgia and excitement as our alumni from across graduating classes engaged in a myriad of activities. The stage came alive with captivating performances by current students. Through the sticker collection tour, they also had the opportunity to revisit and keep a memorabilia of their favorite spots that would soon be rebuilt as the campus enters reconstruction in 2024. At the various game stations, alumni and staff took part in friendly competitions. The joyous reunions where immortalized in the photo booths. It was truly a day where past and present converged, etching another chapter in the history of ASRJC.
