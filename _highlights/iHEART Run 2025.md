<p><strong>ASR iHEART Run 2025: Set Your Pace, Own the Race</strong>
<br>The ASR iHEART Run 2025 brought the college community together in a celebration
of fitness, community spirit, and service. Held on the final day of Term
2 at the Singapore Sports Hub, the event placed a strong emphasis on cardiovascular
health and collective well-being.
<br>
<br><strong>Promoting Wellness and Community Engagement</strong>
<br>This year’s theme, <em>Set Your Pace, Own the Race</em>, encouraged students,
staff, and parents to embrace active lifestyles while moving at a pace
that reflected their personal goals. Students competed in a 4km run, with
some staff running alongside them. Other staff and parents participated
in a separate 1.3km walk. The event also extended beyond race day, with
staff and students contributing additional run and walk distances outside
of school as part of the Inter-Class, Inter-House and Inter-Department
Challenge.</p>

<p><strong>A Heart for Service<br></strong>The event took on added meaning
through Project Sunsetz, a student-led initiative in partnership with the
Singapore Heart Foundation. As part of this project, four students promoted
cardiovascular health and raised funds through the sale of self-designed
t-shirts. Their efforts encouraged the college community to reflect on
the importance of regular exercise—such as running and walking—in supporting
lifelong cardiovascular wellness.</p>

<p><strong>Powered by Collaboration</strong>
<br>The main planning committee from ODAC, supported by classes 25/04 and
25/14 under the guidance of the Physical Education Department, brought
the event to life. The Parent Support Group lent their support by participating
in the 1.3km walk and cheering on students throughout the event.</p>

<p><strong>A Celebration of Spirit</strong>

Beyond the structured competitions, what stood out was the collective joy
and unity that resonated throughout the morning. The ASR iHEART Run 2025
was not just a race—it was a meaningful reminder of the college’s shared
commitment to holistic education and community spirit.</p>
