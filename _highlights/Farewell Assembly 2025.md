<p>On 10 October, we bade farewell to our JC2 cohort with a Farewell Assembly
in the morning. This annual tradition was a time to reflect on the journey
of the past two years, celebrate the memories made, and express gratitude
to teachers, peers, and the school community. The theme, “The Next Level”,
highlighted the significance of the experiences gained this year and looked
ahead to new beginnings. The highlights of the assembly included well-wishes
from teachers and performances by various departments, and of course, a
lively post-farewell assembly carnival.</p>
<p>In the evening, the celebrations continued with the much-anticipated JC2
Prom Night, held at the Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel. A highlight
of the graduating year, Prom Night marked the culmination of the cohort’s
JC experience, as students came together for an elegant evening of camaraderie,
laughter, and shared joy while closing this important chapter.</p>
<p>Together, the Farewell Assembly and Prom Night were truly meaningful and
memorable occasions, honouring the JC2s’ achievements, friendships, and
growth.</p>
