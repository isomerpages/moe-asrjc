Our campus walls have seen a lot. They are not just walls, but a big picture of our life at school. Every bit of paint tells a piece of our story; the nooks and crannies show all the fun and hard work countless batches have put in.

Last month,  the JC1 and JC2 cohorts, came together to bid a fond farewell to these walls. With Project Graffiti,  each class received a wall that they could make their own. The campus became a creative space for students and staff to bond as they decorated the walls with our stories, memories of, and well-wishes for ASR. It allowed us all to leave our mark on our Ang Mo Kio campus and create new memories that will remain with us.

As we prepare to move forward, we reflect on the murals — they have become a vibrant chronicle of friendships, learning, and shared experiences. They have been an outlet for our creativity, the backdrop for countless photographs, and the medium for our goodbyes. Now, as we continue to make our preparations for our Big Move to the Upper Serangoon Campus, we recognise that this is not the end. It is a gateway to new beginnings, with the murals making way for future stories. The joys, the insights, and the spirit we have shared will resonate beyond the paint, shaping our futures and inspiring new students. What we leave behind is not just art; it is a lasting imprint of our collective journey, a legacy that will endure even as we step into the next chapter.
