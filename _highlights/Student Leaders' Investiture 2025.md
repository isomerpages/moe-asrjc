<p>The annual Student Leaders’ Investiture held on 3 July 2025 marked an
important milestone in the college’s leadership journey. This year’s theme, <strong>“<em>Rooted with Purpose, Blossoming with Passion</em>,”</strong> captured
the essence of what it means to serve — to be grounded in strong values
and to lead with heart, dedication, and conviction.</p>

<p>The ceremony paid tribute to the contributions of the outgoing JC2 student
leaders, recognising their commitment, resilience, and service to the college
community. At the same time, it marked the beginning of a new chapter for
the newly appointed JC1 leaders, who will now carry forward the responsibilities
of leadership.</p>

<p>Whether serving as Class Leaders, CCA Leaders, or members of the Student
Council, each leader plays an integral role in shaping the college experience
for their peers.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing our new student leaders lead with purpose and
blossom with passion as they contribute meaningfully to the life of the
college and beyond.</p>
