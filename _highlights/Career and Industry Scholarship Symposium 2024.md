<p>Our annual Career and Industry Scholarship Symposium recently concluded
with great success.&nbsp; The symposium kicked off with insightful keynote
addresses from three distinguished speakers representing diverse fields.
They delved into compelling topics such as the intersection of passion
and income, the evolving landscape of AI-driven employment, and the vast
array of career opportunities within the Science, Technology, Engineering,
Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) fields. Engaged students actively participated
by posing questions and eagerly acquiring knowledge from these esteemed
speakers.</p>

<p>The highlight of the symposium was a series of breakout sessions spanning
13 industries such as medicine, law, IT and entrepreneurship. Students
chose and participated in three sessions aligned with their interests,
where they could interact with industry professionals offering invaluable
insights. Notably, 20 of the speakers were our own esteemed alumni, generously
sharing their professional journeys and inspiring their juniors. Alumni
scholarship recipients also shared their experiences, enriching the dialogue
on career paths and educational opportunities.</p>

<p>To round off the event, students were directed to our newly launched Education
and Career Guidance (ECG) microsite, designed to serve as a comprehensive
resource hub. Here, they can access additional ECG-related information
and view enlightening interview videos featuring professionals from various
fields. Through this symposium, we aim to empower students to explore,
learn, and ultimately embark on purposeful and fulfilling career journeys.</p>
