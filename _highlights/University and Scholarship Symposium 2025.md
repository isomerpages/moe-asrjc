<p>On 22 July 2025, ASRJC held its annual University and Scholarship Symposium,
a key platform designed to support our students in making informed decisions
about their higher educational pathways.</p>
<p>Students had the opportunity to attend talks delivered by alumni and distinguished
speakers, who shared their personal journeys and valuable university information
including admission requirements and career prospects. These sessions,
including the Q&amp;A segments, were professionally facilitated and well-moderated
by ASRJC students.</p>

<p>In addition, our students engaged actively with representatives from the
local universities as well as international education agencies such as
British Council and EducationUSA. These interactions provided them with
valuable insights into local and overseas university admissions, course
offerings, and scholarship opportunities.</p>

<p>This event was well received by students, many of whom actively participated
by posing thoughtful questions and gathering valuable resources to help
chart their academic and career trajectories. The symposium stands as a
testament to ASRJCâ€™s commitment to nurturing future-ready individuals through
informed decision-making and student-led engagement.</p>
