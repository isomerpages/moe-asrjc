**ASR Class of 2022**

This series of individual stories reflect the dynamism of alumni who've recently graduated from ASRJC. Each one of them shares a unique facet of their self, challenges and aspirations while being a student in our college. We put together these different angles celebrate their successes in overcoming their challenges, and also to inspire our current students to strive towards their goals and aspirations.

Before entering ASR, Kiruthekesh (or Kiru as his friends call him) struggled with anxiety and poor self-confidence. But he was determined to overcome this and challenged himself to take up leadership positions to learn, and to serve the ASR community. He became an ICT Champion in the college to lead his peers in digital literacy and he was also a part of the student planning committee for the ASRJC Career and Industry Scholarship Symposium 2022. Not only did these opportunities help Kiru to build his confidence, he also found a sense of purpose in serving the college community.  
  
On the academic front, Kiru found his A-Level subjects challenging and often felt frustrated when he did not meet the standards he set for himself. However, Kiru is grateful for the support he received from his family, teachers, and peers. During his A-Level journey, his parents always encouraged him to focus on the progress that he was making rather than the grades themselves. His Class Mentor, Mdm Vani, also provided him with emotional support and worked with him to formulate revision strategies that helped him to see steady progress in his learning.  
  
Kiru is currently waiting to enlist in National Service and he intends to apply for a degree in Engineering at Nanyang Technological University.

Carina’s life in ASR was definitely a full one. She took part in Chemistry and Biology Olympiads; was a part of [@asr.sc](https://www.instagram.com/asr.sc/?hl=en) as a Student Councillor and organised numerous events from Orientation to Student Leaders’ Investiture; was a member of the student planning committee for the ASR Paves the Way Medical Webinar 2022; was a student moderator for the ASRJC Career and Industry Scholarship Symposium 2022; was a subject representative for her class. The list goes on.  
  
Yet not many might know that Carina has had to deal with several health issues, including having diabetes from a young age. While it was not easy having to manage her health along with her commitments, Carina was driven by a desire to contribute and help others. At ASR, she also found support in her friends and teachers, who looked out for her well-being.  
  
Carina hopes to pursue a career in veterinary medicine and intends to apply for the Concurrent Degree Programme offered by the Department of Biological Sciences at the National University of Singapore and the Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Science at The University of Melbourne.

**Nix Koh Joo Chong**

Nix loved music from a young age and nurtured his interest by joining his primary school’s band as a percussionist. There, his love for music grew exponentially and he discovered the joy of being a part of a team and working together to bring a piece of music to life. In secondary school, he rose to the position of being the Band and Drum Major, fostering that same sense of love for music amongst his band members.  
  
Wanting to pursue a pre-university education in a supportive environment, Nix applied via the Direct School Admission (DSA) pathway to study in ASR. As a part of ASR’s Symphonic Band, he mentored his peers who did not have a background in band, and taught them the foundations of rhythm and technique. In doing so, Nix shared his knowledge and experience with others, and he believes that it made him a better musician. His willingness to reach out to others also earned the respect of his peers, and Nix was chosen to be the Vice-President of [@asr.sb](https://www.instagram.com/asr.sb/?hl=en)  
  
Beyond his musical talents and leadership skills, Nix was also academically driven. As a part of ASR’s talent development programme, he represented the college in national events like the annual Pre-University Seminar and was a recipient of the ASRJC Scholarship.  
  
Upon completion of his National Service, Nix intends to pursue a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science.
