<h2><strong>Release of 2024 A-Level Results</strong></h2>
<p>On 21 February, ASRJCians returned to college to receive the results of
the 2024 GCE A-Level Examinations. We are proud of all 655 of our students;
this was not just a milestone for them but also a celebration of their
resilience, growth, and achievements over the past two years.</p>
<p>Our principal, Mr. Heng Yew Seng, encouraged our graduates to cherish
the memories made in ASR, savor the lessons learned, show gratitude to
those who have supported them, and find ways to pay it forward. He shared
inspiring stories of students who embodied our college values, showcasing
all-round excellence as imaginative thinkers and caring leaders—both within
our school and in the wider community. Additionally, Mr. Heng emphasized
that every ASRJCian’s journey is a unique story worth celebrating, and
that each of them has left a mark on our college’s history.</p>
<p>The class of 2024 has had a journey like no other. They experienced a
dynamic college life that included adjustments to the curriculum, timetable,
and annual calendar—designed to bring out the best in every student. They
were also the first cohort to fully embrace the move from our Ang Mo Kio
campus to the newly refurbished Upper Serangoon campus, adapting to new
spaces while keeping the spirit of ASR alive.</p>
<p>This cohort benefited from an enhanced college calendar rhythm, with a
robust range of programmes—both incumbent and new—that enriched their educational
experience. They also experienced various 21st Century Competencies (21CC)
development initiatives, including the implementation of Design Thinking
and opportunities to hone communication skills and civil literacy.</p>

<p>We are immensely proud of how our students balanced their academic and
non-academic pursuits, built lasting friendships, and navigated challenges
with optimism and grit. They embraced new experiences, led with compassion,
and served with purpose, demonstrating what it truly means to be an ASRJCian.</p>

<p>Our heartfelt thanks go to the parents who have stood by their children
through this journey and to our dedicated teachers and staff who have nurtured,
guided, and inspired our students every step of the way.</p>
<p>As our graduates move on to the next chapter of their lives, we believe
this is just the beginning of many new and exciting adventures. We hope
they carry the lessons, friendships, and values from ASR with them wherever
they go and continue to live by our college motto: Discere Servire – Non
Mihi Solum.</p>
