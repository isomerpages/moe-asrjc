### Support for Parents

ASRJC firmly believes in the strategic partnership between parents and the College to support the holistic development of our students. The College strives to seek out avenues for effective collaboration that value adds to our students' learning experience.

### ASRJC Portal

The ASRJC Portal provides an online platform for parents to keep up-to-date with the progress of their children. Various student information can be found on the Portal, such as class, results, and attendance.

A guide on accessing the ASRJC Portal can be found [**here**](/files/additional-info-instructions-for-accessing-parents-portal.pdf).

### Information & Tips on Supporting Your Child on SDL Days

Our College is committed to nurturing our students to be self-directed learners.

To facilitate this, your child’s timetable will reflect a two-week cycle, with one day per fortnight set aside as SDL Day. SDL Days are meant for students to follow up on their learning goals and to hone their habits of monitoring, consolidating and reflecting on their learning.

Students are not expected to report back to college except for co-curricular activities or special programmes on SDL Days. The campus will remain open for students who wish to do their SDL in the college.
