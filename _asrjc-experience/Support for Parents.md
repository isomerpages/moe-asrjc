### Support for Parents

ASRJC firmly believes in the strategic partnership between parents and the College to support the holistic development of our students. The College strives to seek out avenues for effective collaboration that value adds to our students' learning experience.

### ASRJC Portal

The ASRJC Portal provides an online platform for parents to keep up-to-date with the progress of their children. Various student information can be found on the Portal, such as class, results, and attendance. Parents can access the ASRJC Portal **[here.](https://portal.asrjc.edu.sg/)**

### Parent Kit for Home-Based Learning

A Parent Kit for HBL has been compiled by MOE to explain how home-based learning will work, and how parents can support their children's learning during this period. This has also been sent to parents through the Parents Gateway.
