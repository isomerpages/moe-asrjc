The creative and sporting talents of ASRJC add much to the vibrancy of the college and the standards of excellence that are a hallmark at ASRJC. The performing arts groups have been a galvanizing force in the college's music, dance and drama scene, bringing together students passionate about the arts and providing them with ample performance opportunities both in and out of college.
