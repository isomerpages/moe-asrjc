### Leadership Development

Making decisions, exercising influence, imagining possibilities â€“ these are some of what ASRJC believes is vital for leaders on the cusp of adulthood. ASRJC seeks for every student leader to draw these from their authentic strengths and core values, and exemplify them with tenacity, empathy, and dare.

Leadership Development in ASRJC does not just develop skills and competencies, but also the Heart of a Leader, Leaders who strive to be all that they are, so that others can be everything they can be. The ASRJC Student Leader is nurtured through a developmental curriculum, with key milestone programmes like the Student Leadership Camp, the Leadership Symposia and Conferences, and tested along various leadership pathways that enable each leader to develop a sphere of influence in the College. Invested Student Leaders, for example, lead their classes, CCAs, Houses, and the entire student body. There are also Student Planning Committees for College events that enable young leaders to imagine and bring to life celebration of College spirit.
