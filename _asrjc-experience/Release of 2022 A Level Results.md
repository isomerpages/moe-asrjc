**Release of 2022 A-Level Results**

On 17 February, 664 ASRJCians returned to college to receive the results from the 2022 GCE A-Level Examinations with 95% of them being eligible for local autonomous universities. We are very proud of what our class of 2022 has achieved and how they have found ways to lead, serve and learn during their time in ASR.

We are also very proud of how they have worked hard to find a balance in their academic and non-academic commitments, adapted to changes and stayed resilient. During their time as ASRJCians, they had to manage the uncertainties of ever-changing COVID-19 restrictions and they did so with grace, finding joy and fulfilment in college life and exemplifying our college values.

We thank our parents for being supportive partners and our teachers and non-teaching staff for their hard work and dedication in helping the class of 2022 grow and develop.

As the JC chapter closes for our newly minted alumni, we believe that it is only the beginning of the many exciting adventures ahead for them. We hope that they take their experiences from ASR with them into this next phase of life and continue to hold our college motto close to their hearts. Discere Servire – Non Mihi Solum.

Congratulations to our class of 2022! It’s time to chase your dreams.
