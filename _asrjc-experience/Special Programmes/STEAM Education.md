<h1>Special Programmes</h1>
<h3>Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) Education</h3>
<p>ASRJC offers an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach to learning
through STEAM Education. With inquiry at the heart of STEAM Education,
we explore themes and issues relevant to our students in an authentic setting
across the Sciences, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics
(STEAM). Students will have the opportunity to plan and run STEAM-related
activities. This includes running workshops at our annual ArtScience Festival,
a day set aside for all students to explore concepts or real-life issues
through an interdisciplinary perspective. Through STEAM Education, we prepare
our students to tackle real-world issues and embrace life-long learning.</p>

<p>As the North Zone Centre of Excellence (NZ COE) for STEM and Interdisciplinary
Learning, ASRJC dedicates itself in leading STEM related research, prototyping,
and education amongst schools in the North Zone, and equipping our students
the necessary STEM skills to become “Imaginative Thinkers, Caring Leaders”.
Our specialized PlayP∑n Makerspace Lab, Elementz Lab, and a committee of
teacher mentors promote the interdisciplinary development of STEAM education
through student-driven collaborative projects, STEM workshops, and external
lab or industry attachment.</p>

<p>STEAM education in ASRJC offers an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach
to learning, so as to prepare our students for real-world issues and life-long
learning. This year, the college will host its inaugural STEAM Conference
that showcases the fusion of Arts and Sciences, and the convening of diverse
perspectives to create new ways to visualise the world around us.</p>
<h3>Arts Education Programme</h3>
<p>Our college’s Arts Education Programme is designed for and by our students
in the Arts stream to develop aesthetic sensitivity and cultural awareness,
while exploring issues through socio-cultural perspectives. Students can
look forward to learning opportunities such as plays, movie screenings,
talks by distinguished speakers, and learning journeys to museums. Students
also organise the Arts Symposium, where they showcase their learning and
curate their very own Arts Learning Trail around Singapore.</p>
