Special Programmes
==================

### Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) Education

ASRJC offers an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach to learning through STEAM Education. With inquiry at the heart of STEAM Education, we explore themes and issues relevant to our students in an authentic setting across the Sciences, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics (STEAM). Students will have the opportunity to plan and run STEAM-related activities. This includes running workshops at our annual ArtScience Festival, a day set aside for all students to explore concepts or real-life issues through an interdisciplinary perspective. Through STEAM Education, we prepare our students to tackle real-world issues and embrace life-long learning.

### Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Programme

**Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Programme**

As the North Zone Centre of Excellence (NZ COE) for STEM and Interdisciplinary Learning, ASRJC dedicates itself in leading STEM related research, prototyping, and education amongst schools in the North Zone, and equipping our students the necessary STEM skills to become “Imaginative Thinkers, Caring Leaders”. Our specialized PlayP∑n Makerspace Lab, Elementz Lab, and a committee of teacher mentors promote the interdisciplinary development of STEAM education through student-driven collaborative projects, STEM workshops, and external lab or industry attachment.

STEAM education in ASRJC offers an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach to learning, so as to prepare our students for real-world issues and life-long learning. This year, the college will host its inaugural STEAM Conference that showcases the fusion of Arts and Sciences, and the convening of diverse perspectives to create new ways to visualise the world around us.

### Arts Education Programme

Our college’s Arts Education Programme is designed for and by our students in the Arts stream to develop aesthetic sensitivity and cultural awareness, while exploring issues through socio-cultural perspectives. Students can look forward to learning opportunities such as plays, movie screenings, talks by distinguished speakers, and learning journeys to museums. Students also organise the Arts Symposium, where they showcase their learning and curate their very own Arts Learning Trail around Singapore.
