### ASR International Narratives (ASR I.N.)

ASR I.N. prepares students for immersive local and overseas learning experiences, and focuses on building their understanding of global issues through inter-disciplinary study. The programme allows students to widen their intellectual horizons, experience the outdoors, gain cultural awareness, and exchange ideas with youths in Asian countries. Anchored in the college’s values of integrity, humility, empathy, adaptability, respect and tenacity, the programme encourages active discourse about one’s role in building a better future and provides students the platform to turn ideas into action. Countries that students have visited include China, Thailand and Vietnam.
