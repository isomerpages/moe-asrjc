<p>Our students enter the college with diverse aspirations. The Talent Development
Programme, a.k.a. <strong>ASR Scholars Programme</strong>, empowers our
students to fulfil their aspirations, through a wide range of intellectual
and co-curricular opportunities to develop the students in 6 key areas:
leadership, academic, community service, expanding perspectives, skills
and achievements.</p>
<p>In addition, the college is proud to offer the ASRJC College Advisory
Committee (CAC) Scholarship, awarded to top students who have demonstrated
exceptional academic achievement, outstanding co-curricular involvement,
and strong leadership qualities. Valued at S$1,000 per annum and tenable
for two years, the CAC Scholarship provides not only financial recognition
but also the opportunity for recipients to be groomed under the ASR Scholars
Programme, further empowering them to thrive as future-ready leaders.</p>
