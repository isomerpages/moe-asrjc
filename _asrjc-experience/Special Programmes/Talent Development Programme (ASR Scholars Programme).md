### Talent Development Programme (ASR Scholars Programme)

Our students enter the college with diverse aspirations. The Talent Development Programme, a.k.a. ASR Scholars Programme, empowers our students to fulfil their aspirations, through a wide range of intellectual and co-curricular opportunities to develop the students in 6 key areas: leadership, academic, community service, expanding perspectives, skills and achievements.

In addition, the ASRJC College Advisory Committee (CAC) offers scholarships to outstanding JC1 students who excel in their academic and non-academic domains. The scholarship is worth $1,000 per annum, tenable for 2 years subject to satisfactory academic performance and conduct at JC1. The CAC Scholarship awardees will be enrolled into the Alpha Programme.
