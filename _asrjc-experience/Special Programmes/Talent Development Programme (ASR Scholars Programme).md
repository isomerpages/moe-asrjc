<p>The <strong>ASR Scholars Programme</strong> equips students with the confidence,
curiosity and character to excel in scholarship pathways and make meaningful
contributions to society. Through workshops, dialogues and leadership experiences,
students develop critical, adaptive and inventive thinking, reflective
habits and a broad understanding of national and global issues. They learn
to respond to challenges with creativity and sound judgement, while communicating
and collaborating effectively.</p>
<p>Anchored in ASRJC’s iHeart values and guided by our motto Discere Servire:
Non Mihi Solum (“To learn to serve, not for myself alone”), the ASR Scholars
Programme nurtures scholars who lead with integrity, empathy and purpose.
The programme also strengthens students’ civic, global and cross-cultural
literacy, enabling them to engage diverse perspectives, navigate complexity
with maturity and make decisions that balance personal conviction with
collective well-being.</p>
<p>In support of this mission, the college also offers the ASRJC College
Advisory Committee (CAC) Scholarship, which recognises outstanding students
who exemplify academic excellence, strong CCA involvement and leadership
potential. Beyond the accompanying financial award, recipients benefit
from enhanced developmental opportunities under the ASR Scholars Programme—expanding
their exposure, sharpening their competencies and positioning them to grow
as future-ready leaders.</p>
<p>Together, the experiences prepare ASRJC scholars to serve with heart,
think with clarity and lead with impact, demonstrating resilience, collaboration,
empathy and the courage to blaze new paths for themselves and others.</p>
