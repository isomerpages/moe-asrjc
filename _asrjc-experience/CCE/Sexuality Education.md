<h3>Sexuality Education</h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>MOE</strong>  <strong>Sexuality Education in Schools</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools
aims to enable students to understand the physiological, social and emotional
changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
with others, including those with members of the opposite sex, and make
wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised
on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means
encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units
with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based
on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious
communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality
Education are to:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Support
students in managing their physiological, social and emotional changes
as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guide
students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality
matters.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help students
develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and others by having
positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality that are premised
on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of
Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love and
respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build
positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation
for strong families);</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstinence
before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended
pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.</p>
