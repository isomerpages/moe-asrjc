<h3>Sexuality Education</h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>MOE</strong>  <strong>Sexuality Education in Schools</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools
aims to enable students to understand the physiological, social and emotional
changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
with others, including those with members of the opposite sex, and make
wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised
on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means
encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units
with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based
on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious
communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality
Education are to:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;Support students in managing their physiological, social and
emotional changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions
on sexuality matters.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves
and others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality
that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of
Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which
are the foundation for strong families);</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society;
and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>

<p><strong><em>eTeens</em></strong>  <strong>Programme</strong>:</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>eTeens</em> is a programme that
was developed by Health Promotion Board, in collaboration with the Ministry
of Education, to provide JC/MI Year 1 students with accurate information
on STIs/HIV and protection from a health perspective. With the formation
of the Communicable Diseases Agency (CDA) on 1 April 2025, the programme
would now be managed by CDA’s Training and Education Division instead of
HPB. The desired outcome of the eTeens programme is that students are empowered
to make wise, informed and sensible decisions to protect themselves from
sexually transmitted infectious diseases.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students learn the health, social
and financial implications of STIs/HIV on an individual and the family,
and the importance of responsible decision-making and seeking help. Abstinence
and upholding family values are the key messages.</p>
<p><strong>At Anderson Serangoon Junior College, the <em>eTeens</em> programme will be implemented as follows in 2026</strong>
