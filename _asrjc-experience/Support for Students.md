<h4>FAQs</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is counselling?</p>
<p>Counselling simply refers to the process of talking to a trained professional
in the aim of addressing any social, emotional or psychological issues
that a person may have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is counselling done?</p>
<p>Counselling is usually done one-to-one in the counselling room. This is
done so as to provide a conducive and safe environment for effective counselling
to take place. In unique situations, counselling may be done in a group
setting. All sessions are kept confidential EXCEPT when there is reason
to believe that the client will:</p>

dealt with. Termination of the sessions can either be initiated by the
counsellor or the client.</p>

can be made either through SMS or email. The contact info can be found
