<h3><strong>STEAM Education</strong></h3>
<p>ASRJC offers an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach to learning
through <strong>STEAM Education</strong>. With inquiry at the heart of STEAM
Education, we explore themes and issues relevant to our students in an
authentic setting across the Sciences, Technology, Engineering, the Arts
and Mathematics (STEAM). Students will have the opportunity to plan and
run STEAM-related activities. This includes running workshops at our annual
ArtScience Festival, a day set aside for all students to explore concepts
or real-life issues through an interdisciplinary perspective. Through STEAM
Education, we prepare our students to tackle real-world issues and embrace
life-long learning.</p>
